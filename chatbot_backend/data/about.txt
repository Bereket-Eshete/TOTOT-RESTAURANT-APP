Totot Traditional Restaurant – About Us

Totot Traditional Restaurant is one of Addis Ababa’s most iconic culinary and cultural destinations. Founded in 1999 by Meskerem Abera, a passionate advocate for Ethiopian heritage and cuisine, Totot was created to preserve and showcase the richness of Ethiopia’s food, music, and tradition in one immersive experience.

Meskerem, a former hotelier and lifelong food lover, was inspired by her grandmother’s cooking and the communal spirit of Ethiopian dining. She envisioned a space where guests could not only eat but also feel deeply connected to Ethiopian history and culture.

Starting with just a modest dining hall, Totot has grown into a cultural landmark visited by locals, tourists, diplomats, and celebrities alike. Over the years, Totot has hosted traditional weddings, music nights, state dinners, and community celebrations — all while staying true to its roots.

Today, Totot is still family-run, with Meskerem’s daughters helping to expand the brand into catering services and pop-up festivals. But the mission remains the same: share Ethiopia’s warmth and flavor with the world.

We believe in:
- Preserving heritage through taste and tradition
- Welcoming everyone like family
- Supporting local farmers and artisans
- Providing a stage for local artists, dancers, and chefs

Totot is not just a restaurant — it’s a story you taste.
